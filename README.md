# Esri CloudXR Demo

![image](arcgis-maps-sdk-unity-samples.png)

Here is a VR demo developed by ESRI within the Unity Engine. It is built off the [ArcGIS SDK Unity VRSample](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-maps-sdk-unity-samples/tree/main/samples_project/Assets/SampleViewer/Samples/VRSample), incorporating more interaction and diverse features in order to utilize the demo in tandem with [Nvidiaâ€™s CloudXR Application](https://developer.nvidia.com/cloudxr-sdk). The main branch is configured to work with our ArcGIS plugin version 1.3.0. If you would like to build the application to a VR headset you would need to switch to the URPBuild branch since Android does not support the HD Rendering Pipeline we use in the main branch.

## Features
* Continuous viewing and movement in 8 cardinal directions.
* Choice between continuous or snap turning.
* Ability to explore 7 unique real world locations, showcasing Esri data and map components.
* Ability to change the time of day, and therefore the lighting.
* Ability to change weather components from sunny to rainy.
* Ability to select a surface on the map to get the address of that location.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Refer to the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unity's documentation on getting started](https://developers.arcgis.com/unity/get-started/) on how to download `Unity` and the `ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unity`.
3. Open the project in Unity ignoring the errors when prompted to enter `Safe Mode`.
4. Use the package manager to import the `.tarball` downloaded in step 2.

6. If there are still errors, locate the ArcGISMapsSDK Assembly Definition within the folder `Assets -> Samples -> ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unity -> 1.3.0 -> Sample Content -> Arc GIS Maps SDK.Samples (asmdef)` and add the `Unity.InputSystem` asmdef to the references. Make sure to click *Apply* at the bottom.

7. Launch Unity and open the `VR Sample` level.

8. In the hierarchy select the `ArcGISMap` Game Object. In the inspector set the API key on the ArcGISMap Component. You can learn more about [API keys](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/security/api-keys/) and [Accounts](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/deployment/accounts/) in the _Mapping APIs and location services_ guide.

9. (Optional) If you want to be able to open the `.cs` files in this project and have intellisense recognize variable correctly, in Unity navigate to `Edit -> Preferences -> External Tools -> Generate .csproj files for 'local tarball`

## Requirements
